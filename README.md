**1. Comprehensive Monolith Architecture** <br/>
_Swiggy Clone_: Developed a mini Swiggy clone that integrates every key feature of the React library, utilizing live Swiggy APIs exclusively. The project serves as a perfect example of how reconciliation and virtual DOM work in React, optimizing performance and user experience.<br/><br/>

**2. Tailwind CSS Integration**<br/>
_Responsive UI_: Implemented Tailwind CSS to design a responsive and modern UI that mirrors Swiggyâ€™s aesthetics.<br/><br/>

**3. Efficient Routing with React Router**<br/>
_React-Router-Dom_: Leveraged React Router for client-side routing, ensuring smooth and dynamic navigation across the application.<br/>
_Lazy Loading_: Enhanced performance by implementing lazy loading of routes, reducing the initial load time and improving the user experience.<br/><br/>

**4.Higher-Order Functions for Code Enhancement**<br/>
_Reusable Components_: Utilized higher-order functions to enhance and reuse components, adhering to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and promoting clean, maintainable code.<br/><br/>

**5. Adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle**<br/>
_Modular Design_: Followed the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to create modular components, ensuring that each component has a clear, focused purpose.<br/><br/>

**6. Custom Hooks for Reusable Logic**<br/>
_Efficient State Management_: Developed custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.<br/><br/>

**7. Context API to Resolve Props Drilling**<br/>
_Simplified State Sharing_: Employed the Context API to avoid props drilling and simplify state sharing across deeply nested components. This implementation made the code cleaner and easier to manage.<br/><br/>

**8. State Management with Lifting State Up**<br/>
_Profile Debugging_: Implemented the technique of lifting state up to ensure data consistency across components. This approach facilitated easier debugging, particularly in profile management and other critical state-dependent features.<br/><br/>

**9. Redux for Scalable State Management**<br/>
_Redux Architecture_: Integrated Redux as the state management library, following best practices in its architecture. This includes the use of actions, reducers, and middleware for handling side effects, ensuring a predictable and centralized state management solution.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
